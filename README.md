**<Synopsis>**
In a small coastal town, the aging lighthouse keeper, Mr. Elias, and his grandson, Jamie, faced a crisis when the town council decided to replace the old lighthouse lamp with a modern electronic navigation system. During a fierce storm, the new system failed, jeopardizing the safety of ships at sea. In desperation, Elias handed Jamie an old lantern to signal the ships, a dim but steadfast light. Jamie's brave effort with the lantern successfully guided a ship to safety, proving the old lighthouse's worth. The council restored and enhanced the lighthouse, learning the value of blending tradition with innovation. Inspired, Jamie eventually became the lighthouse keeper, merging old and new navigational methods to ensure the lighthouse remained a reliable beacon. This story underscored the enduring importance of wisdom and tradition in modern times.

### Learning programs

1. wordcloud
- 수업 전에 브레인 스토밍으로 단어를 보여준 뒤 내용 창작해보기 or voca 수업 시 활용
- 수업 후 마무리 활동으로 단어를 보고 1m summary 해보기.




허깅페이스 = colab+ 언제든지 사이트에서 실행 가능 (=언제든지 사람들이 접속 가능한 코드 프로그램)
-> 허깅페이스에 코드를 만들고 링크를 qr코드화 시켜서 공유하면 교수님이 좋게 보실 듯. (MK316: 학생들이 좋아할 듯을 가장 잘 생각하는 수업이 제가 가장 좋게 볼 포인트입니다 :-))

레슨플랜을 간단하게 짜볼까요?
