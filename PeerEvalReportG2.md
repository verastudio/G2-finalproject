# 💕 Peer Evaluation & Presentation Review for Group 2 (0619, by MK316)

+ Your presentation on integrating various apps to facilitate listening and especially writing activities in the classroom was impressive. The inventive use of QR codes and the classroom dictionary created via Google Sheets/Excel showcased a thoughtful approach to managing classroom vocabulary, making it easily accessible for students. Your initiative to enable students to engage creatively through the Letter Maker app was highly effective, providing a meaningful connection to the character in the story while offering scaffolding for writing tasks.

+ The highlights of your presentation clearly reflect your strengths in "Integration," "Autonomy," and "Adaptability," which are evident in the way you've seamlessly incorporated these technological tools into the learning environment. Your attention to ensuring that apps are not only engaging but also effective in achieving educational goals is commendable.

+ However, there are some areas for refinement. For instance, ensuring the clarity of dictionary definitions and considering the proficiency levels of students when selecting vocabulary can enhance understanding and accessibility. Additionally, the email quiz and checking in with students might need some adjustments to ensure comprehension and engagement. For example, instead of asking "do you understand?" which often leads students to respond affirmatively regardless of their actual understanding, you might consider asking more open-ended questions or requesting examples to ensure they truly grasp the content.

+ The feedback from your peers suggests that while the variety of apps was generally well-received, focusing on fewer, well-integrated tools could potentially increase effectiveness. Moreover, incorporating more listening comprehension activities and ensuring that all students, regardless of their language proficiency, can benefit from the tasks are essential steps forward.

+ In terms of presentation (Prezi) and integration, your work was outstanding and entertaining. Your effort to create a lively and encouraging classroom atmosphere did not go unnoticed and was greatly appreciated by all attendees. As you move forward, continue to refine your application of these innovative tools, balancing technological engagement with educational outcomes. Keep up the excellent work, and I look forward to seeing how you will further develop these ideas to enhance student learning even more effectively.

|2|I loved the use of QR codes. The google sheet/excel use to make a classroom dictionary is such a good idea to make the classroom vocabulary manageable for students. I really love the letter maker. It gives the students a way to relate to the character in the story. The scaffolding for this activity was also really good by providing options for the introduction and conclusion. The grandpa reply was really cool! I like that the teacher checked in with the students. I like that the last writing activity lets the students be more creative!
|3|Good job|
|4|레터메이커는 창의적이고 좋았어요.|
|5|Letter Maker|
|6|Online dictionary apps targeting the target students can be useful.|
|7|Overall presentation and lesson plan are well-organized.|
|8|전반적으로 앱구성이 좋았습니다. 특히 학생들이 앱에 접근하는 방식과 사용하게 하는 방식이 쉽고 이해하기 좋았습니다.|
|9|장르를 기반으로 한 쓰기 연습이 유용했다고 생각합니다. 쓰기는 가르치기 어려운만큼 다양한방법으로 지도할수록 좋다고 생각합니다.|
|10|정보를 어떤 식으로 어떻게 사용할 수 있다는 점, 즉 target learner와 situation에 따라 코딩을 무궁무진하게 활용할 수 있다는 점이 인상깊었습니다. 또한 학생들을 중심으로 그들이 직접 task를 완수함으로써 수업의 흥미도, motivation 에 코딩이 직접적으로 기여할 수 있음을 시사하였습니다.|
|11|I can make the app which help writing. I can give some examples using drop down. Guided writing app was a very nice idea!|
|12|여러 language skills를 앱에 잘 녹여냈다.|
|13|학생들이 템플릿을 사용해서 이메일 쓰는 양식을 배워보도록 하는 부분이 인상깊었다.|
|14|Integration and Presentation were outstanding from this group's presentation.| 

## [3] Essay feedback 2: _What aspects should the presenting group have paid more attention to?_

|1|Nothing|
|2| The dictionary definitions may be a bit difficult for the students to understand so they should be simplified. Is this meant to be a listening lesson or a reading lesson? If it's listening, it might be a good idea to listen to the story once before and then to have only images for the story order activity. Also, you might want to do some modeling for the students like how to upload to Padlet (unless they've done it before). I also think some of the vocabulary in the letter maker activity is a little bit above the student's level so it might be very difficult for lower-level students. In regards to the email quiz, was this information taught in the lesson explicitly or in a previous lesson? When checking in with students, the teacher should be careful not to say "do you understand?" as students will say yes even if they don't. Rather, they can ask them to answer a question.|
|3| Great|
|4| Nothing|
|5| Clear instruction of activities.|
|6| Adaptability - how to cover level differences among students|
|7| 딱히 없었습니다. 준비가 잘 되어있었다고 느꼈습니다.|
|8| 학습자들의 상호작용적인 요소, 실제 편지에 답장을 쓰는 부분이 인상깊었습니다.|
|9| 허깅페이스도 좋은데 기회가 된다면 young learner를 위해서 배경이 알록달록하고 글씨체가 customazed 되는 그런 프로그램을 연구해 보고 싶습니다.|
|10| I personally think that there were many activities to do in one class. I think more opportunities to listen to the listening text and comprehend are needed.
|11| 들어가야할 앱(ex. Google Form, Huggingface)이 한 가지 통로가 아니라서 아쉬웠다.|
|12| If their applications focus more on different skills not just focusing on writing, it will be more effective and useful. I liked most of their presentation, though. Especially, I liked how the teacher kept encouraging and tried to lead a bright atmosphere.|
|13| Nothing special|
